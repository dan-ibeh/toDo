# How To Submit Your Assingment

Thre are multiple routes, at which you can take:

1. You could begin your assingment, by pulling this repo first and then trying to solve assingment
2. You could solve your assingment, then pull this repo before making a commit of your solution

But to submit your assingment, you are required to **create a branch** on this repo and **push** to your solution to it.
The branch you create should be named after you.

**Ensure to send your github profile or email to me, so i can added you, as a collabrator to this project.**
## For Frontend Guys

You should create your own personal repo and push your solution to it. This way, you would be able to create a github page and confirm that your solution actually **renders on the web**.

Do not forget to create a branch on this repo and push your solution to it.

## For Backend Guys

You do not have to create a personal repo for your solutions, you can just create a branch on this repo and push your solutions to it.
**Ensure all of your files are in the same folder** before pushing to the branch.
